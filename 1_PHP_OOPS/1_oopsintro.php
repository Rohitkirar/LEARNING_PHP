OOP Stands for OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING;

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or function that perform operations on the data, while  object oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-Oriented Programming has several advantages over prodedural programming 
-> OOP is faster and easier to execute.
-> OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
-> OOP helps  to keep the PHP code DRY "DON't REPEAT YOURSELF" and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
->OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less and shorter development time.

TIP : DRY principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

What are CLASSES and OBJECTS ?

Classes and Objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.

Basically, Class is a template for objects and object is an instance of  a class.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properitites and behaviours from the class but each object will have different values for the properties.
