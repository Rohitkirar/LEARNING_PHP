    -> HAVING clause is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to filter the groups based on a specified condition.
    -> HAVING clause allows you to apply a condition to the groups returned by the GROUP BY clause and only include groups that meet the specified condition.
    -> The HAVING clause evaluates each group returned by the GROUP BY clause. If the result is true (1), it includes the group in the result set.
    -> Itâ€™s possible to form a complex condition in the HAVING clause using logical operators such as OR and AND.
    -> If you omit the GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause behaves like the WHERE clause.

    -> HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

    -> The HAVING clause is only useful when you use it with the GROUP BY clause to generate the output of the high-level reports.
