/*
    -> MySQL UNION operator allows you to combine two or more result sets of queries into a single result set.
        SELECT column_list
        UNION [DISTINCT | ALL]
        SELECT column_list
        UNION [DISTINCT | ALL]
        SELECT column_list
        ... 

    -> these are the basic rules that you must follow:

    * First, the number and the orders of columns that appear in all SELECT statements must be the same.
    * Second, the data types of columns must be the same or compatible.

    NOTE : By default, the UNION operator removes duplicate rows even if you donâ€™t specify the DISTINCT operator explicitly.

    -> If you use the UNION ALL explicitly, the duplicate rows, if available, remain in the result. 
        Because UNION ALL does not need to handle duplicates, it performs faster than UNION DISTINCT .

    -> UNION vs. JOIN
        A JOIN combines result sets horizontally, a UNION appends result set vertically. 

    -> As you can see from the output, the MySQL UNION uses the column names of the first SELECT statement for the column headings of the output.
        If you want to use other column headings, you need to use column aliases explicitly in the first SELECT statement 
    
    -> If you want to sort the result set of a union, you use an ORDER BY clause in the last SELECT statement 

    -> MySQL also provides you with an alternative option to sort a result set based on column position using ORDER BY clause
    NOTE : However, it is not a good practice to sort the result set by column position.
