/*
    We can use JOIN clause in the UPDATE statement to update rows in one table
    based on values of another table.
    The UPDATE JOIN is useful when you need to modify data across related tables

    UPDATE T1
    [INNER JOIN | LEFT JOIN] T2 ON T1.C1 = T2.C1
    SET T1.C2 = T2.C2, 
        T2.C3 = expr
    WHERE condition;

    WE CAN use ONLY INNER JOIN AND LEFT JOIN TO UPDATE DATA
