-> the LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, 
	irrespective of whether a matching row from the right table exists or not.

-> In the absence of a match, the columns of the row from the right table will be filled with NULL values.

-> The LEFT JOIN clause is very useful when you need to identify rows in a table
 that doesnâ€™t have a matching row from another table.
 
-> Notice that for INNER JOIN clause, the condition in the ON clause is equivalent to the condition in the WHERE clause.
