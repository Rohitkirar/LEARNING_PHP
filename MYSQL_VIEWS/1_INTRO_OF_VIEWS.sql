/*
a view is a named query stored in the database catalog.

A better way to do this is to save the query in the database server and assign a name to it. 
This named query is called a database view, or simply, view.

To create a new view you use the CREATE VIEW

 a view does not physically store the data. 
 When you issue the SELECT statement against the view, 
 MySQL executes the underlying query specified in the viewâ€™s definition 
 and returns the result set. 
 For this reason, sometimes, a view is referred to as a virtual table.
